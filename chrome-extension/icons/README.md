# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons should:
- Use the SwiftCareer branding/colors (LinkedIn blue #0A66C2)
- Be clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Follow Chrome extension icon guidelines

## Placeholder

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images as placeholders until proper icons are designed.
